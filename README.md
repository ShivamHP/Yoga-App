## Architecture used
MVVM architecture is being used in this app.
Model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) ‚Äì be it via a markup language or GUI code ‚Äì from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform. The viewmodel of MVVM is a value converter, meaning the viewmodel is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented. In this respect, the viewmodel is more model than view, and handles most if not all of the view's display logic. The viewmodel may implement a mediator pattern, organizing access to the back-end logic around the set of use cases supported by the view. 

## Open for suggestions
As a part of the exercise, there should be little-to-no bugs, and, moreover, it is expected to arrange the code in a readable/understandable manner.
But, this code may not adhere to some of the regulations, so feel free to suggest some code arrangements that could make the code more readable!
ü§ê You can easily increase your points(and reduce mine) by pointing out code structure.
ü§ó I don't have found any other issues, but would love to hear something that I have missed!

## Improvements that should have been done

The UI that was on mind was:
![Imaginated UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45695285/170888488-330c83a9-3622-4b9b-a4cf-89da2a5dba56.png)
I was not able to find a way to have corners rounded in card and image views (under time limit). There is a 3rd party library by which this can be done - but I would like to find the issue why my code is not making those round corners as it should have done.
